The level tracks correspond to these levels respectively:

Level 1: Mungola
Level 2: Snowy Mountains
Level 3: Sky
Level 4: Jungle
Level 5: Volcanic Caves
Level 6: Underwater
Level 7: Overseas
Level 8: Collosatropolis

Baddie Tune 1 will accompany levels 1 and 2.
Baddie Tune 2 will accompany levels 3 and 4.
Baddie Tune 3 will accompany level 5.
Baddie Tune 4 will accompany level 6.
Baddie Tune 5 will accompany levels 7 and 8.
Finale will cover level X.

The world level select screen in the 'Concepts' folder should provide a general idea of the level placement
(we'll probably model a new world to better present this)

NOTES:

Level 2 track is repetitive, planned to trim down.

While Level 5 differs somewhat from the other tracks, it can fit very well with the hardcore environment and difficulty in mind for the volcanic caves.

Baddie Tune 3 will be tailored to the boss, having an intro + looping sections for each phase of the battle.

Baddie Tune 4 is chill.
